## Description

Bootcamp Project 1 - Party Planner Site

Motivation: 
This project aimed to create an all-in-one platform that relieves the stress of party planning for people who want to host events. Planning can be overwhelming, whether it's a birthday, wedding, or corporate event. This website aims to streamline the process by offering easy-to-use tools and resources for planning any celebration, instilling confidence in users that their event will be a success.

Why This Project: 
We built this project to solve a common problem: the hassle of coordinating various aspects of a party, from managing guest lists to booking vendors and selecting themes. Party Planners provides a comprehensive solution, instilling confidence in users that they can organize all their party details in one place.

Problem Solved: 
The site simplifies event planning by offering features such as guest list management, MVP, all in one platform. This eliminates the need to juggle multiple tools or services, saving users time and allowing them to focus on other aspects of their event.

Lessons Learned: 
We learned how to integrate multiple services into one cohesive web application throughout the development process. We also gained experience in user experience (UX) design, database management, and ensuring the platform's scalability to handle various event sizes.
